          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lead">Are Connecticut and Massachusetts distributing education funding equitably across their public school districts? This analysis examines whether spending per student varies dramatically between districts, whether higher-poverty schools receive more funding to address their students' additional needs, and whether different types of schools: traditional public, charter, and specialized districts receive comparable resources. By comparing these two neighboring states with reputations for strong education systems, we can understand whether their funding models actually deliver fair opportunities to all students.</p>

          <p>Spending per student represents the total dollars a district invests in one child's education each year, encompassing everything from teacher salaries and textbooks to building maintenance and transportation. This figure matters because funding levels often determine education quality, yet money doesn't always flow where it's needed most. The analysis focuses on three key dimensions: First, the overall landscape examining whether vast disparities exist in what different districts spend. Second, the relationship between spending and student poverty, measured through free and reduced-price lunch eligibility, which serves as a reliable indicator of which families struggle to make ends meet. This reveals whether poor communities receive extra resources to help their students succeed, or whether wealthy areas actually spend more per child. Finally, district type traditional public schools, charter schools, and specialized schools operate differently and may receive different funding levels.</p>

          <p>This investigation matters deeply to communities, families, and policymakers because education funding shapes children's futures and either perpetuates or disrupts cycles of inequality. When high-poverty districts receive less funding than wealthy ones, students who already face obstacles at home: food insecurity, unstable housing, limited access to healthcare also encounter fewer experienced teachers, larger class sizes, outdated materials, and crumbling facilities at school. Understanding these funding patterns helps community advocates push for fairer formulas, allows parents to see whether their district is under-resourced, and gives voters concrete information when deciding on budgets and leadership. Moreover, by comparing Connecticut and Massachusetts, communities can learn from each other's successes and failures, identifying which funding approaches actually narrow opportunity gaps versus those that merely maintain the status quo. In a democratic society that promises equal opportunity, how we fund schools remains one of the most consequential decisions we make about our collective future.</p>

      <h2>Findings</h2>

     
<p>When comparing district spending, it is worth noting the amount of districts between each state. Massachusetts had 302 public school districts in the 2023-24 academic year, with an average of $21,885 per student.(MA Department of Education)  Connecticut has 169 school districts, with the average per pupil spending in Connecticutbeing around $22,054 for the 2023-24 school year. (CT School & State Finance Project.<p>



            
     <iframe title="Per Pupil Expenditures (MA)" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-nyOtf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nyOtf/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="880" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>     


            <p>This table shows the highest Per Pupil Expenditures in Massachusetts public school districts. Pronvicetown has the highest PPE, spending roughly $48,000 per student. What is interesting to note however, is that the districts with the highest PPE typically has a smaller student demographic, evidently eight out of the eleven highest PPE districts have less than five hundred students.</p>

          <p>This table highlights the Connecticut public school districts with the highest per-pupil expenditures. Notably, the three districts at the top are not traditional school districts, yet they still appear in Connecticut’s official district records. Regardless, Connecticut’s highest spending public school district is higher than Massachusetts. <p>

<iframe title="Percent of Low Income Students to Per Pupil Expenditure (MA)" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-HQPI4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HQPI4/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="415" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
            
<p>The scatterplot shows the relationship between Massachusetts Per Pupil Expenditure and the percentage of low income students in each school district. The correlation between the two variables is .1, signifying that there is barely any relationship between the two variables however the trend line appears positive. The biggest outlier is Provincetown whose PPE is around $48,000 and the percentage of low income students is about 40%. <p>

            <p>The scatterplot shows the relationship between Connecticut Per Pupil Expenditure and the percentage of low income students in each school district. The scatterplot shows a correlation of -.16, contrasted to Massachusetts’ scatterplot, Connecticut has a negative trend line. Due to the three non-school districts, Connecticut has substantially more outliers such as EdAdvance whose percentage of eligible free/reduced lunch is 67.3% and their PPE is $59,528.</p>

          <h2>Sources & Methods</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can prepare a JPG or PNG file (preferably with all lower-case text and no spaces in the filename) and upload it directly into your GitHub repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image1.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Next, write an HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
